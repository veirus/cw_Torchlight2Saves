This is my personal save games for `Torchlight 2` unmodded singleplayer. 

This repo has two purposes: 
1) experimenting with 'recovery points' for characters and loot, so if something goes wrong i can always rollback a character or stash and do a respec and start a new build or recover an item. Somewhat cheaty but saves me from excess grinding; 
2) learning git. 

I already screwed it up by not making a branch per character, but "Experiment is experiment!" as said by Mentor in Strugatsky bros book "The Doomed City". So everything is about to change.
